Welcome, this was my solution to codeacademy's Feature Request: Jammming (React.js) project.

You can view the project in action at [http://eric-jammming.surge.sh/](http://eric-jammming.surge.sh/ "Eric's feature request project").

I opted to add track previewing functionality. I hope that you find this helpful. Happy coding.
